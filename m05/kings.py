rules = '''The object of this game is to be the first to have 5 or fewer points
in your hand. The point values for each card are as follows:

  * Aces are 1 point.
  * Numbered cards have their face value in points.
  * Jacks and Queens are 10 points.
  * Kings are 0 points.

There are two players in the game, and each is dealt 5 cards.
The remaining cards form the stock pile. The top card on the
stock pile is turned over to create the discard pile.

The first player begins by choosing to pick up the top card
on the stock or discard pile. They then select a card from
their hand to discard, and they place it face-up on the
discard pile.

If at the start of a player's turn, the player has three
cards in their hand with the same face value, they may skip
taking a new card and directly discard the three matching
cards. This play will leave them with just two cards,
instead of five, in their hand.

At the end of a player's turn, if the point value of a
player's hand is 5 or less, they shout "I am King" and
the game is over.
